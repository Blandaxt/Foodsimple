# My Food simple express

This application can retrieve a random food from the internet. It allows users to post messages to my database. It also allows the user to delete messages and rate them by thumbs up and down.

## How It's Made:

*Tech used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Template engine (ejs) and Node.js.

I built this application by first setting up my npm dependencies like my node_modules folder. Then i focused on building my template and connecting my complex api. Then i focused on my javascript to make sure i can parse my json object. Then i put on some styles on it and ran it to make sure everything was working perfectly. Lastly, i downloaded a fon_awesome file for my dependencies.

## How to use:

1. Clone this repository

2. Download the npm dependencies for node.

3. Use the terminal to run it.

4. click on the button to see what sort of food recipy you got.

5. Then leave a comment.

### Optimization

If i had more time, i would make the submit button not reset the whole file and send fetch request instead or reloading the whole body. I would also further add some more styling to my text and set a border for my images that show up from my API. Lastly, i would add some credentials from other developers who helped me with ideas and research material.
